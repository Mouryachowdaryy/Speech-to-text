Thanks for the clarification! Here's your updated `README.md` tailored specifically for a **Jupyter Notebook-based Speech-to-Text NLP project** — not Google Colab — but still written in a similar clean, modern style:

## 🗣️ Speech to Text (Jupyter Notebook)

A lightweight speech-to-text app built in Jupyter Notebook using Python's `speech_recognition` library. It allows you to record voice through your computer’s microphone and converts it into readable text using Google's Web Speech API.

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Clone or Download the Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text.git
cd speech-to-text
```

**2. Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyaudio
```

> ⚠️ Note: `PyAudio` may require additional setup based on your OS:
>
> * **Windows**: Install via `.whl` from [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
> * **Linux/macOS**: Use `brew install portaudio` or `apt install portaudio19-dev` before `pip install pyaudio`

**3. Open the Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook "speech to text.ipynb"
```

**4. Run the Notebook**

* Execute each cell step-by-step
* When prompted, speak into your mic
* The model prints your recognized speech below

---

### 🎯 Features

* 🎙️ Real-time voice recognition using your microphone
* 🤖 Uses Google Web Speech API via `speech_recognition`
* 📋 Outputs human-readable text transcription
* 🧠 Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook UI
* ⚙️ Completely local (no frontend/UI required)

---

### 🛠️ How It Works

**Notebook Flow**

1. Imports and initializes `speech_recognition.Recognizer()`
2. Opens microphone using `Microphone()` context manager
3. Captures user speech
4. Sends audio to Google for transcription using `recognize_google()`
5. Displays the transcribed text output

### 🧪 Example Output

```
Please speak something...
✅ You said: Hello, this is a speech-to-text test.
```
